Using a very popular dataset “Northwind sample database” perform a self join in “Customers” table
Write a SQL statement to matched customers that are from the same city:

SELECT c1.CustomerName, c2.CustomerName, c1.City
FROM Customers c1
INNER JOIN Customers c2
ON c1.City = c2.City AND c1.CustomerID <> c2.CustomerID;

Write a Right join SQL query to specify that we want to perform a RIGHT JOIN, specifically looking for matches between the departments table and the employees table.
DepartmentID is common in both tables

SELECT *
FROM employees
RIGHT JOIN departments
ON employees.DepartmentID = departments.DepartmentID;

We have two tables:
employees - This table contains each employee’s ID, name, and department ID.
(image)
departments - This table contains each department’s ID and name
(image)
try to find a column that exists in each of the tables. In this example, it is the department_id column

SELECT *
FROM employees
JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

Write a SQL statement to join two tables Customers and orders, select all customerName from the customer, ordersId from orders, and any orders they might have:
Left join using unique customerID column in both the tables and order the CustomersName by Ascending.

SELECT Customers.customerName, Orders.orderId 
FROM Customers
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Customers.customerID = Orders.customerID
ORDER BY Customers.customerName ASC;


5
Write a SQL statement, to join the two tables using inner join: Customer table with Orders table both have customerID common in them and extract OrderID, OrderDate from Orders, CustomerName from Customers.

SELECT Orders.OrderID, Orders.OrderDate, Customers.CustomerName
FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Customers
ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
