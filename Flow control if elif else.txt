Accept three sides of a triangle and check whether it is an equilateral, isosceles or scalene triangle.
Note :
An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal.
A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides.
An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides.

print("Input lengths of the triangle sides: ")
x = int(input("x: "))
y = int(input("y: "))
z = int(input("z: "))

elif x==y or y==z or z==x:
    print("isosceles triangle")
else:
    print("Scalene triangle")
